- Convolution is fundamental operation in signal processing and linear systems theory that describes how two signals interact with each other to produce a third signal in **[[ LTI System]]**
  
- #properties and definition of system
	- System is a process / operation that transform input $x(t)$ to output $y(t)$ 
	  
	-  Assume that we input the signal / function $x_{1}(t)$ to the process $h(t)$ that return the signal / function $y_{1}(t)$, In the same way if we take the $x_{2}(t)$ to the process $h(t)$ it will result the $y_{2}(t)$ as well
	  
- To understand this topic we need to understand the **System** first. There are a number of basic #properties of [[Continuous-time Signal]] and [[Discrete-time Signal]] (Classification of System)
  
	- [[Linearity]] (Linear / Non-Linear)
	- [[Time Invariance]] (Time invariance / Time Varying)
	- [[Memory]] (With memory / With out Memory)
	- [[Causal]] (Predictable / Not predictable)
	- [[Invertibility]] (Can / Can't calculate inverse)
	- [[Stable]] (Stable / Not stable)
