- #properties 
	- Causal (predictable) system  is the system that depend only on values of input $t \leq t_{0}$ 
	- All of [[Memory]]less system is a causal system!
	- This work on both [[Discrete-time Signal]] and [[Continuous-time Signal]]
	  
- #example 
	- $y[t] = 2x[t]$ is causal system
	- $y[t] = x[t-3] + 15$ is causal system
	- $y[t] = x[t] + x[t+1]$ ==is non causal system==
	- $y[t] = x[2t]$ ==is non causal system==
