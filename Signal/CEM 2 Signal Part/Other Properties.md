- **Even signal
	- Even Symmetric signal
	- #properties 
	  signal $x(t)$ is identical to its time reflection about origin that mean
						  $x(t) = x(-t)$
	- #example 
		- $cos$ signal
	
- **Odd signal 
	- Odd symmetric signal
	- #properties
	  signal $x(t)$ is equal to product of -1 and its time reflection about origin
						  $x(t) = -x(-t)$ 
	- #example 
		- $sin$ signal

- For **any signal** $x(t)$ can be decomposed in to a sum of odd and even signal
						  $x(t) = x_{odd}(t) + x_{even}(t)$ 
  
  We can find the odd and even signal that sum up to signal $x(t)$ 
  using this #formula 
  
	  $x_{even}(t) = \frac{1}{2}[x(t) + x(-t)]$
	  
	  $x_{odd}(t) \;= \frac{1}{2}[x(t) - x(-t)]$
